    <p>INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS PSYCHIC?</p>
</div>


<h3>
  Being Psychic Isn’t Easy, And Many People Have <br> Misperceptions About What This Gift Actually Entails.
</h3>

  <p class="body01">
    I’ve come to realize that when many of us hear the word “psychic,” we imagine a neon-lit storefront, decorated 
    with crystal balls, fog machines, and animatronic contraptions that manipulate supernatural occurrences — the true essence 
    of “smoke and mirrors.”
  </p>

  <p class="body02">
    For many of us, the first step in tapping into our extrasensory abilities is divorcing this concept from deception. While there are 
    definitely many charlatans who either exaggerate their skills or make them up entirely, these individuals are not psychics: They are 
    con-artists who use fear tactics to prey on gullible or vulnerable individuals. In most cases, pretending to be psychic is just one of 
    many exploitative schemes for these imposters.
  </p>


  <p class="body03">
    Psychics, on the other hand, are simply individuals who are able to see, hear, feel, sense, taste, or have intuition beyond the boundaries 
    of the physical world. It is difficult, perhaps even impossible, to firmly define what society deems “normal” perception. After all, we are 
    conditioned to believe that our perception of reality is fairly concrete: We assume that everyone knows the sky as blue or can detect when 
    someone is in a cranky mood. But as we continue to expand this sensory spectrum, we quickly realize that certain senses become increasingly 
    less common among our peers. It is through this awareness that many of us become aware of our unique, inherent psychic gifts.
