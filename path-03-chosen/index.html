        <p>THE PSYCHIC SPECTRUM: FRIEND #3</p>
    </div>

    <p class="body01">
        The third friend enters the restaurant. As she approaches the host stand, she is overwhelmed with stimuli: 
        She notes the restaurant’s garish decor, the servers’ swift movements, and a particularly loud gentleman in the 
        back of the room who seems to be dominating the conversation. His energy is arrogant and abrasive, and his young 
        children appear both embarrassed and afraid. Will they grow to adopt his behavior, or will they reject it and 
        become soft and docile?Suddenly, the third friend snaps back to reality as the maître d' asks how she can help. 
        Once she arrives at the table, she immediately shares her observations with her dinner mates.

                It may sound trite, but one of the best ways to access your psychic skills is through the subconscious. 
                In our daily lives, we are constantly creating boundaries to limit how much stimuli we ingest — and with 
                good reason. In order to live healthy, functional lives, we simply cannot absorb everything we encounter. 
                Accordingly, these experiences are often stored within our psyche.
           
            <br> 

            The fastest way to tap into your psychic abilities is to cultivate a healthy relationship with your subconscious mind. 
            Dreams are a great pathway into this realm: They symbolize the alternative reality to our waking world. Free of physical 
            constraints, we can move effortlessly between spaces — exploring foreign lands, traveling to bygone eras, and encountering 
            otherworldly spirits. Dreams are a portal, and the more acquainted we become with this subconscious realm, the more easily
            we are able to access the full spectrum of our psychic gifts. Be sure to always keep a pen and paper close to your bed: 
            As you become increasingly  comfortable with your subconscious, you will begin to realize the incredible fluidity between worlds.
