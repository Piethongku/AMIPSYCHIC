        The first individual to arrive approaches the host stand, speaks with the maître d', and is led to the table. 
        After sitting, she notices that she’s missing a fork and that her water glass has already been filled. She’s quite thirsty, 
        so she takes a sip.

                Another great way to cultivate your psychic abilities is to practice “environmental scans.” To do this, 
                position yourself in the center of a room. Move around the space (either physically, or just with your eyes), 
                noting the sights, sounds, and scents. Which areas are the most inviting? The least? Explore the corners, the windows, 
                the furniture. How do these energies make you feel? 
           
            <br> 

                I know this exercise may seem a bit awkward at first, but trust me, 
                no one will notice your psychic exploration. Practice these environmental scans in different areas — parks, bars, offices, 
                and even subway cars. The more you become aware of your surroundings, the easier it will be for you to pick up on subtle 
                shifts in energy. Eventually, you’ll be able to extrapolate this skill to past memories, as well as future happenings.

                This is the first step to astral projection, the ability to wilfully manifest out-of-body experiences. Of course, astral 
                projection takes years of practice, but environmental scans will help deepen your psychic practice.
