        Shortly after, the second friend enters the restaurant. He approaches the host stand and notices that maître d' 
        is scrolling through Instagram on her phone. Unsure of whether the maître d' is bored or indignant, the second 
        individual delicately gets the hosts attention through a gentle greeting. The host is gracious and welcoming, and 
        the second individual is immediately relieved. The host leads the second individual to the table, where he sits down, 
        greets his friend, and proceeds to review the menu.

                Imagine meeting up with an old childhood friend who you haven't seen in decades. You're excited to reflect on memories, 
                and can distinctly remember your unique interpersonal dynamic. But a lot has changed since your playdates, and although your 
                old buddy is still the same person, in many ways, you're now complete strangers. In order to build a new friendship, you'll 
                need to get to know each other all over again.
                
            <br> 
                
                In order to tap into your psychic abilities, treat your intuition like this old childhood friend. Of course, you're familiar 
                with your intuition — it's always been part of your spirit. But you may have a completely different way of working together 
                than you did in the past. 
           
            <br> 

            Cultivate a relationship with your intuition by developing a daily practice. One simple exercise 
            involves assigning colors to your emotions. Start by considering a very straightforward experience, such as a frustrating 
            conversation with your boss or flirty text exchange with your crush. Next, choose colors to associate with these feelings 
            (in this example, let’s select yellow and pink, respectively). Over time, this color will become synonymous with that emotion 
            and your intuition will be able to communicate through this non-verbal language. Once the color has been fused with the energy, 
            your intuition will be able to signal on events outside your immediate realities. So if you see pink when your friend starts 
            telling you about her new coworker, you’ll immediately know that there’s a romantic link.
