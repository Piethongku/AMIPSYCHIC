        <p>THE PSYCHIC SPECTRUM: FRIEND #4</p>

      Finally, the fourth friend walks into the restaurant. Upon entering, he’s completely 
      overwhelmed by the movement, sounds, lights, and smells. Within an instant, he’s aware 
      of interpersonal dynamics at each table, the complex relationships between the servers, 
      the pungent odor of a particular dish that reminds him of childhood, and a few charred 
      rafters on the ceiling. Had there been a fire? Suddenly, he senses an extreme heaviness 
      (something bad happened here) and — avoiding the maître d' — hurries towards the table of 
      friends. He tries to shake off these experiences, but they continue to linger throughout dinner.

              As an astrologer, tarot reader, and occult practitioner, 
              it’s quite easy for me to tell whether a client is psychic — 
              certain planetary placements in a birth chart, card spreads, 
              or even casual conversations about manifestation reveal an 
              individual’s extrasensory perceptions. Although I’m always 
              thrilled to meet other super-feelers and am eager to share my 
              observations, I always proceed with caution: Being psychic isn’t
              easy, and many people have misperceptions about what this gift 
              actually entails. Working with psychic skills requires patience, 
              practice, and lots of self-love.
